# How to visualise Twitter mentions (Sankey Diagram)

This repo is very simple - it just shows you how to harvest Twitter data via the API and then visualise mention networks as a Sankey Diagram.
- On the left hand side, you'll see the target account you're monitoring .
- On the right hand side, you'll see all accounts mentioning your target. The size of the bars is based on the number of tweets mentioning your target account.

Of course, you will need to use your own information for the Twitter API - get started here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard

The output of the process is as in the figure below:
